# Gold_extraction_optimization_with_machine_learning

## Problem Solving
I developed a machine learning model for Zyfra, a company specializing in efficiency solutions for the heavy industry, to predict gold extraction from minerals. Leveraged real extraction and purification data to optimize production, eliminate unprofitable parameters, and improve operational efficiency while reducing costs.
